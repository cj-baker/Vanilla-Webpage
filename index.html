            <p>
              Hey there, my name is Casey Baker and I am from Vancouver, WA. I
              have been in the tech field for a couple years now, which has made
              for a much more stationary life. Adriene Mishler and her Yoga with
              Adriene platform has helped me stay in both good mental and
              physical health despite my work from home lifestyle.
