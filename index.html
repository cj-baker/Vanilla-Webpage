              <h1>About Adriene Mishler</h1>
              <p>
                Adriene Mishler is a professional Yoga instructor and the
                Producer/Host of Yoga with Adriene, a free YouTube channel
                focused on teaching everyone mindfulness and how to, as Adriene
                says, "find what feels good". Adriene has become an inspiration
                to many individuals, including myself, to do something that is
                easier said than done: Show up for yourself. Her videos promote
                self-love, positivity, and a physically healthy lifestyle.
                Adriene's audience is anyone wanting to try or continue
                practicing yoga, she leaves space on her channel for beginners,
                intermediates, and pros alike. If the Yoga with Adriene YouTube
                channel is not content for you, she also now has an SVOD
                (Streaming Video On Demand) Service that you can find on her
                FWFG (Fidn What Feels Good) Website.

            <p>
              Hey there, my name is Casey Baker and I am from Vancouver, WA. I
              have been in the tech field for a couple years now, which has made
              for a much more stationary life. Adriene Mishler and her Yoga with
              Adriene platform has helped me stay in both good mental and
              physical health despite my work from home lifestyle.
